# Inforce Frontend Test Task

Welcome to the Inforce Test Task. You can see the list of products. This list is developed using React, SCSS, TypeScript, and Material UI.

Key Features:
- Sorting products: you can sort products alphabetically or by count.
- Removing products: the warning modal appears before removing, so you're in good arms and you won't remove product accidentally.
- Adding products: there is a validation what data was entered and it's impossible to create a product with empty data.
